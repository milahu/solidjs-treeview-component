## aria spec

https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#TreeView

> A tree view widget presents a hierarchical list.  
> Any item in the hierarchy may have child items,  
> and items that have children  
> may be expanded or collapsed to show or hide the children.
>
> For example, in a file system navigator  
> that uses a tree view to display folders and files,  
> an item representing a folder  
> can be expanded to reveal the contents of the folder,  
> which may be files, folders, or both.
